<p class="risk-warning">Source: The graph above shows the performance of our {{strategy.name | lowercase}} investment strategy from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018. These figures are shown together with average peer returns that have equivalent risk levels for comparison. The average peer returns benchmark is provided by the Asset Risk Consultants (ARC). Performance is shown after fees but before any tax that may be due. Past performance is not a guide to future performance, and the value of investments can fall as well as rise.

      <h4>Our Returns</h4>
      <p>The returns shown here are calculated based on actual Investec Click &amp; Invest portfolio returns from
          five seeded portfolios set up on 1 January 2016, and are based on an initial account size of £10,000.
          Performance is shown after fees but before any tax that may be due.</p>
      <h4>Average Peer Returns</h4>    
      <p>This data is based on monthly results published by Asset Risk Consultants (ARC). ARC is a peer
          group benchmark which shows the average returns from discretionary investment managers based
          on risk profile, after fees.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of accurate comparison, we have matched our five strategies to the following ARC
          classifications:</p>    
      <ul>
        <li><span>Click & Invest Defensive</span> = Sterling Cautious</li>
        <li><span>Click & Invest Cautious</span> = Sterling Cautious</li>
        <li><span>Click & Invest Measured</span> = Sterling Balanced</li>
        <li><span>Click & Invest Adventurous</span> = Sterling Steady Growth</li>
        <li><span>Click & Invest Aggressive</span> = Sterling Equity Risk</li>
